## Aboute me (Sobre mim)
Life is grateful

Regardless of the day, I will set aside at least 1 hour of the 5 working days of the week to program and rekindle the embers that surround my knowledge. This is my goal for 2025 for the rest of my life and as long as I have a computer nearby, I will fulfill this statement, whether in health or in sickness.
